  author={Gye-Jeong Kim, Seung-Cheon Baek, Hyun-Sook Lee, Han-Deok Lee and Moon Jeung Joe},
  abstract={The ever-increasing requirement of high performance and huge capacity memories of emerging consumer electronics appliances, such as mobile phone, digital camera, MP3, PMP, PDA, etc., has led to the widespread adaptation of flash memory as main data storages, respectively. As a result, managing the data on flash memory has been gaining in significant to satisfy the requirement of mobile embedded applications. However, the read/write/erase behaviors of flash memory are radically different than that of magnetic disks which make traditional database technology irrelevant. In this paper, we introduce LGeDBMS, a scale-downed DBMS engine designed for flash memory and its application. Finally, we demonstrate a PIM(Personal Information Management) application on a mobile phone using LGeDBMS.},

  title={Regulating I/O Performance of Shared Storage with a Control Theoretical Approach},
  author={Han Deok Lee, Young Jin Nam, Kyong Jo Jung, Seok Gan Jung and Chanik Park},
  abstract={Shared storage has become commonplace with recent trends in storage technologies, such as storage consolidation and virtualization, etc. Meanwhile, storage QoS, which guarantees different storage service requirements from various applications toward shared storage, is gaining in importance. This paper proposes a new scheme which combines a feedback-controlled leaky bucket with a fair queuing algorithm in order to deliver guaranteed storage service for applications competing for shared storage. It not only assures an agreed-upon response time for each application, but also maximizes the aggregate I/O throughput by proportionating unused bandwidth to other active applications. Simulation results under various types of competing I/O workloads validate the features of the proposed scheme.},
